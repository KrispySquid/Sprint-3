# Sprint-3

In the end I chose to install Fedora on my Asus laptop. In the process, I learned a lot about Fedora, operating systems, and Linux in general. Some prod I found with using Linux is that makes my laptop faster and smoother. Some cons I found was that a lot of the apps I am used to using are not always supported by Linux, and when they are, they do not always support Fedora, so in hindsight, Debian or Ubuntu probably would have worked better.
